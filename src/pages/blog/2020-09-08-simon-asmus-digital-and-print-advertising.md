QUESTION - What did you wish you knew before you started your venture? ANSWER - Starting iCatching Media i had been pretty prepared as i have had previous experience and learnt alot of lessons in previous businesses and jobs. If i was to pick one thing it would be to know the industry a bit more as i had never had a job within this space. Print is a pretty technical industry if you dont know what printers are best for each particular job.
