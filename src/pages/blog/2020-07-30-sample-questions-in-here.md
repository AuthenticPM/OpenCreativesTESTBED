### 1. Does My Idea Meet a Need?

“First and foremost, you need to make sure that your idea is servicing a need. Is there a gap in the market? Why should your target market and the wider population care about this idea? At the end of the day, if there’s no audience, there’s no million-dollar idea. Once you can honestly answer these questions, you can look more seriously at taking your idea and turning it into a viable business.” ~ [Stephen Ufford](https://twitter.com/StephenUfford), [Trulioo](http://www.trulioo.com/)

### 2. Is This Feasible?

“You need to determine if you can afford to build out this business idea, if your family or anyone else close to you can handle this change, and whether you have the drive and determination to go the distance. It often is just about the idea, with little thought to the reality. Most entrepreneurs think they can just figure it out as they go. In reality, they need to know in advance.” ~ [Serenity Gibbons](https://twitter.com/serenitygibbons), [Calendar](https://www.calendar.com/)

### 3. Does My Product Add Value to a Customer’s Life?

“If not, don’t do it. As a man who has seen thousands of pitch decks, a business should not be pursued if it isn’t just that: a business. An idea doesn’t make money, time away from your children cannot be easily scaled, and for the most part, people have everything they need. Which means, you shouldn’t be in business unless you are adding value to people’s lives that they didn’t have before.” ~ Jason Criddle, [Jason Criddle and Associates](http://jasoncriddle.com/)

### 4. Can I See Myself Doing This for Years?

“The beauty of entrepreneurship is that you can see the future. Literally, entrepreneurs see the world with their product or service solving a problem that exists today. What we see less well are the road bumps: problems and inevitable challenges that will shake your resolve. You’ll need to be willing to commit if you want to see it through.” ~ [Jeff Epstein](https://twitter.com/jeff_epstein), [Ambassador](https://getambassador.com/)

### 5. Does It Work Within the Life I Want to Have?

“Building a business can be a huge time and energy sink and before you enter in, it’s important to be clear about the implications it will have on your life. Are you willing to put in the hours and energy, to suffer the ups and downs, say “no” to other things like time with friends and family or your hobbies? Make sure it’s worth it to you before you dive in.” ~ [Darrah Brustein](https://twitter.com/DarrahB), [darrah.co](http://www.darrahbrustein.com/)

### 6. Can It Be Monetized?

“All too often, entrepreneurs and creative individuals come up with grand ideas. Sometimes these ideas even solve important problems. While the good of the world is a great motivating factor, the most important element is whether or not it can be monetized. If your idea can’t generate income, move on to another that can and come back to your goodwill project once you’ve made money elsewhere.” ~ [Claudio Sorrentino](https://twitter.com/ClaudSorrentino), [Body Details](http://www.bodydetails.com/)

### 7. Can I Sell My Wife on the Idea?

“Getting buy-in from the wife is the ultimate test on whether an idea should be acted upon. If I can sell my wife on the idea, it’s a great idea. But, if I pitch to the wife and she’s not convinced, the idea most likely should constitute a “pass.” Relying on your partner to be an unbiased, external judge is a great way to separate the great ideas from the good ones, because they know you too well.” ~ [Brett Farmiloe](https://twitter.com/BrettFarmiloe), [Markitors Website Development](https://markitors.com/wordpress-website-development-services/)

### 8. Can I Get a Complete Stranger to Buy My Product?

“People lie. People lie to their close friends and loved ones. People lie for convenience and to avoid conflict. Your family and close friends might not tell you the truth, if it means crushing your dreams. Try selling your product to complete strangers. The absolute best way to hear true feedback is from a stranger who is paying you their hard-earned money.” ~ [Kevin Tao](https://twitter.com/kevintoaster), [NeuEve](https://www.neueve.com/)

### 9. Am I Motivated or Just Passionate?

“It’s important to know the difference between being motivated by something and being passionate about it. The obvious difference is that passion is fleeting and one should strive to find long-term motivators in one’s business.” ~ [Nicole Munoz](https://twitter.com/nicolemunoz), [Start Ranking Now](http://www.startrankingnow.com/)

### 10. What Is the Legal Landscape?

“Never was the old adage that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” more true than when pursuing a new business idea. Before you invest any time and money, first check in with a business attorney to make sure you understand what you will be legally required to do when pursuing your idea and the ongoing legal costs and risks.” ~ [Doug Bend](https://twitter.com/DougBend), [Bend Law Group, PC](http://bendlawoffice.com/)

### 11. What Am I Giving Up?

“Any time a new shiny object comes across your desk, there is always an associated cost of doing business. What are you going to lose by spending time on a new project instead of your existing business? How much are you prepared to lose by shifting your focus to something else? Either way, you’re losing something, so is it worth it?” ~ [Drew Gurley](https://twitter.com/drewgurley), [Redbird Advisors](http://redbirdagents.com/)





**1. Why do I want to start a business?**

This may seem obvious, but sometimes we want to start a business without even thinking about the why. What sparked your business idea and is it something you are extremely passionate about doing?

**2. Can this business idea make me money now and in the future?**

If the answer is no, then you may want to reconsider. You don’t want to pursue a business idea for it to cost you more than what you make. Yes, money isn't the most important factor, it is the outcome but it is your responsibility to ensure the business has financial viability.

**3. Who is my target audience for my business?**

You need to tailor your business to a specific target audience. This will be helpful when you are advertising and marketing your business to the niche audience and producing products that they would consume. You need to remember your business cannot be for anyone and everyone, find a niche market and focus on them as this will lead to financial rewards later on.

**4. Who are my competitors?**

Usually the business idea you have come up with exists somewhere out there, there may even be several variations of your business already. So, it is important to research other businesses similar to yours and see what yours can offer that makes you stand out. Analyse competitors, see how they interact with customers online, how they present their products and how strong their brand is.

**7. How will I price my products?**

You don’t want to over priced, but you don’t want to price your products too low. This is where research comes in handy as you want to look at what your competitors’ price their products at. Are your items the same, more luxurious or more simple? You also want to take into consideration the packaging and postage costing as well as maintaining the business overall. Where do you fit in the market for your target consumers?

**8. Do I have the funds to start this business?**

Before you begin making money, you need to put money into your business to start it up. So before beginning, the best thing to do is produce a list of all the things you’ll have to buy before you can officially launch your business.

These may include:

\- Registering your company name

\- A website

\- The product itself / service creation

\- Packaging

\- Labels

\- Money towards advertising and marketing

These are only a few things to consider, but only buy what you absolutely **need**, not what you’d ideally want. These will follow as your business grows.

**9. Am I extremely motivated and passionate?**

It is easy to say you want to have your own business, but do you see yourself doing this for a while? Are you extremely passionate about this business idea and motivated that you will work on it consistently until it grows?

**10. Can I do this alone?**

You need to reflect on the team you need, will you be able to manage this business completely by yourself, or do you need others that you would be able to rely on to help you throughout your journey. Maintaining a business by yourself is not easy and so you may want to consider having someone by your side that is as motivated and passionate about the business. Or joining a community of like minded entrepreneurs.

**11. How many employees will I need?**

So, you’ll be starting this business solo or with a business partner, but you also want to consider how many employees you will need as the time goes on. This is important to consider if you are beginning a business with the idea that it will scale up in the future, and require a team for growth. Or if you have chosen a 'company of one' how many people do you need to make it efficient.

**12. What resources do I already have?**

You might get ahead of yourself and think about what you don’t have, but ask yourself what do you already have? Make sure to utilise the resources already available that may you can save money and time.

**13. Are you ready to invest your time into this business?**

Managing a business takes a lot of time, money and energy in order for it to be successful. So, you want to make sure you are in a good place in your life to begin a business. You also need to be prepared to take a lot of risks and sacrifices to make the business work!

**14. How will I set up the legal structure of my business?**

It is important to research the legal structure of your business, depending on the product or service you will be selling. Make sure you have chosen the legal structure that secures your business and protects you.

**15. What kind of taxes do I have to pay?**

These are also the type of questions you will need to be thinking about when you begin your business. As it will be considered your job, it is a legal requirement that you state how much you earn and therefore be taxed by the government. So, this is an important part of research when you are starting a business.

**16. What are my goals?**

Yes, you want to start your business but what are your goals with it? Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years time? These are some thoughts to have before you begin, it is important you see your business as a long-term goal where one day you will make your income from your business alone.

**17. When will I be ready to start?**

Make a plan of an ideal date you want to launch your business and work towards it! Create a to-do list and tick off the tasks as you go along in preparing to launch your business. Be realistic about your launch date and plan accordingly.

There are so many questions you need to ask yourself as you get started, the 17 above will get you started and your mentor would be able to help you with the initial questions.

Remember, starting a business isn’t easy and will require a lot of time, patience and energy! Fall in love with your business idea and watch it grow as well as making sure to plan
