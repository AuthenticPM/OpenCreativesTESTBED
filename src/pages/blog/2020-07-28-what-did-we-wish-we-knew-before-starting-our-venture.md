### Origins of the word and concept[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Club_(organization)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Origins of the word and concept")]

It is uncertain whether the use of the word "club" originated in its meaning of a knot of people, or from the fact that the members "clubbed" together to pay the expenses of their gatherings. The oldest English clubs were merely informal periodic gatherings of friends for the purpose of dining or drinking with one another.[Thomas Occleve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Occleve "Thomas Occleve")(in the time of[Henry IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England "Henry IV of England")) mentions such a club called*La Court de Bonne Compagnie*(the Court of Good Company), of which he was a member. In 1659[John Aubrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aubrey "John Aubrey")wrote, "We now use the word clubbe for a sodality \[a society, association, or fraternity of any kind] in a tavern."

### In Shakespeare's day[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Club_(organization)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In Shakespeare's day")]

Of early clubs the most famous, latterly, was the[Bread Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_Street "Bread Street")or Friday Street Club that met at the[Mermaid Tavern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid_Tavern "Mermaid Tavern")on the first Friday of each month.[John Selden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Selden "John Selden"),[John Donne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne "John Donne"),[John Fletcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fletcher_(playwright) "John Fletcher (playwright)")and[Francis Beaumont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Beaumont "Francis Beaumont")were among the members (although it is often asserted that[William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare")and[Sir Walter Raleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Walter_Raleigh "Sir Walter Raleigh")were members of this club, there is no documented evidence to support this claim). Another such club, founded by[Ben Jonson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson "Ben Jonson"), met at the Devil Tavern near[Temple Bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Bar,_London "Temple Bar, London"), also in[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London").

Coffeehouse in[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London"), 17th century

The word “club,” in the sense of an association to promote good-fellowship and social intercourse, became common in England at the time of*[Tatler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatler_(1709) "Tatler (1709)")*and*[The Spectator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spectator_(1711) "The Spectator (1711)")*(1709–1712). With the introduction of coffee-drinking in the middle of the 17th century, clubs entered on a more permanent phase. The coffee houses of the later[Stuart period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_period "Stuart period")are the real originals of the modern clubhouse. The clubs of the late 17th and early 18th century type resembled their[Tudor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_dynasty "Tudor dynasty")forerunners in being oftenest associations solely for conviviality or literary coteries. But many were confessedly political, e.g. The Rota, or Coffee Club (1659), a[debating society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debating_society "Debating society")for the spread of republican ideas, broken up at[the Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Restoration "The Restoration")in 1660, the[Calves Head Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calves_Head_Club "Calves Head Club")(c.1693) and the[Green Ribbon Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Ribbon_Club "Green Ribbon Club")(1675). The characteristics of all these clubs were:

1. No permanent financial bond between the members, each man's liability ending for the time being when he had paid his “score” after the meal.
2. No permanent clubhouse, though each clique tended to make some special coffee house or tavern their headquarters.

These coffee-house clubs soon became hotbeds of political scandal-mongering and intriguing, and in 1675[King Charles II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England "Charles II of England")issued a proclamation which ran: “His Majesty hath thought fit and necessary that coffee houses be (for the future) put down and suppressed,” because “in such houses divers false, malitious and scandalous reports are devised and spread abroad to the Defamation of his Majesty’s Government and to the Disturbance of Peace and Quiet of the Realm.” So unpopular was this proclamation that it was almost instantly found necessary to withdraw it, and by[Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain "Anne, Queen of Great Britain")’s reign the coffee-house club was a feature of England’s social life. See[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_coffeehouses_in_the_17th_and_18th_centuries "English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries").
