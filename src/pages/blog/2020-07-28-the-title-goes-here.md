**What inspired you to write the film in the first place?**I decided to write a script first. Originally, it was supposed to be a play, presented in a theater. I’ve been in many different relationships. I studied acting for many many years, and I say, “Let me write a script and try to make a movie.” That’s when everything start, you know. I take a lot of stuff from real life, as well as from my own experiences.*The Room*, I always say, is a red flag for young people. Have fun, but, at the same time, the message behind it — what not to do in the real world, you know. Relationships between three people, as a friend it’s okay, but then you go extra miles, it’s not good.

**When did you start work on it?**I was working already in 2001, 2002, but we released in 2003, but we were shooting 2002, so five years before prior to the shoot.

**Did you always intend it to be a comedy?**Let me say it this way. I’m as a director speaking now. It’s my job as a director to provoke the audience. Provoke the audience, by my taking, you provoke by comedy or drama. I was planning to do reality. Otherwise, we don’t relate to it. If you want to attract the audience you have to be real. Even sci-fi movies, you see, you can suck the audience into your screening, given certain imagination, and they will connect to it.*The Room*is the same thing. The reality is there. That was my attention to certain styles of comedy. Because I say, “Well, people don’t talk that way to people, don’t yell this way.” But you have instances that you took from life, that I have some friends that are very dramatic, you know, with girls for example. But that’s a unique approach to relationships. But we do have in society certain individuals that they act that way. But we as a so-called normal people, generally speaking, we don’t accept that. And I say, “No,*The Room*has to be that way.” Otherwise, imagine, if you take certain elements from*The Room*, it would be not the same. So, I was looking always for uniqueness.

I’ll tell you a little secret. I was driving in Los Angeles and I say, “Well Johnny has to be naked!” Because, you see, how you present a love scene by just a kissing the person. Well, everybody can kiss, but you don’t go from A to Z by kissing someone. You cannot show the relationship fully. And if you want to provoke the audience you have to go an extra mile.

**Where did the quotes \[on the film’s original advertising materials] come from? Did you just make up the quotes?**I don’t know about that. I received dozens, actually hundreds from the beginning, almost hundred of emails about thank-you about this, thank-you about that. It was just overwhelming what people want from me, and that’s when I come out with this idea, I say, “Let’s just show*The Room*once a month, midnight screening, have a Q&A and I enjoy it very much.”

**Was it popular when it was released the first time?**\
We had a mixed reaction, to be honest with you. Then we go across the country. We show actually in New York one time, we show in Florida, we show in Berkeley. And we got the same reaction and I was thrilled by it. Funny story, in Florida, the girl said to me, “We want to see again.” I say, “You have to talk to the manager, I’m not in charge here.” I was thrilled. I was on dozen of screenings, and I observed the audience, and I love it. I really enjoy it, the way they react, I really enjoy, I really really enjoy it. Because, you see, that’s exactly what I want. I was planning to provoke the audience and I did my job, you see. The movie’s not a boring movie, it’s just that you have to interact — if you*want*to, it’s not like everybody has to — but I think you can get something, you relate to it, that’s important to me.
